* ##[NOAA_LC12.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_LC12.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the NOAA data off the west coast of BC and US.  

* ##[NOAA_CUC.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_CUC.ipynb)  
    
    In this notebook, we look at the spatial variability of the California Undercurrent between $42^\circ N$ and $48^\circ N$.  

* ##[NOAA_MB07.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_MB07.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the NOAA data off the west coast of BC and US.  

* ##[Untitled.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/Untitled.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook bins casts differently and calculates dominant water properties slightly differently than the previous NB.  

* ##[NOAA_find_eddy_water2.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_find_eddy_water2.ipynb)  
    
    USES EXTENDED WOD13 DATA  
      
    This notebook attempts to determine the source of the 33.9psu, 6.3$^\circ C$ water that was found in the 2013 Falkor Cruise around MB07 and LB08.  

* ##[NOAA_observed_levels.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_observed_levels.ipynb)  
    
* ##[NOAA_find_eddy_water.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_find_eddy_water.ipynb)  
    
    This script attempts to determine the source of the 33.9psu, 6.3$^\circ C$ water that was found in the 2013 Falkor Cruise around MB07 and LB08.  
      
    Loading data takes roughly 43s.  

* ##[NOAA_annual_JdFE_waters.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_annual_JdFE_waters.ipynb)  
    
* ##[hist_TS.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/hist_TS.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook shows TS plots with histogram frequency data. histxy command courtesy of Kyle.  

* ##[NOAA_eddy_water_variability.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/falkor_upwelling/raw/tip/1_Notebooks/NOAA_eddy_water_variability.ipynb)  
    
    In this notebook, we track with higher precision how the eddy water changes with year.
