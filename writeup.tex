\section{Juan de Fuca Eddy}

\subsection{Description}

The eddy is a cyclonic feature located off the entrance to Juan de Fuca strait. It is seen in the summer as a consequence of northwesterly wind stress producing a southeastward current. This southeastward current produces upwelling conditions along the coast of Southern Vancouver Island.

Authors use ROMS to investigate the formation of the reported Juan de Fuca eddy.
